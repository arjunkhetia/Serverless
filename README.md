The quickest way to get start with Serverless Framework for AWS, API Gateway, Lambda Functions, S3 Storage & CloudWatch, just clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/arjunkhetia/Serverless.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start local API server at `http://localhost:3000/`, (Note: aws-sdk must be installed and configured for the IAM user with proper permissions and Docket must be installed):

```bash
$ npm start
```
